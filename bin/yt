yt - YAML Tester for Perl Implementations

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    # Run tests with yt
    > yt
    > yt -MYAML::Syck
    > yt -MYAML::Tiny -v dump.t load.t

    # List the yt tests
    > yt --list

    # Run benchmarks against the various YAML modules
    > yt --benchmark
    > yt --benchmark -r5000   # Run 5000 times
    > yt --benchmark YAML::Syck YAML::LibYAML   # Compare two modules

    # Show the version of yt, YAML::Tests and the YAML modules on your system
    > yt --version

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This command line tool, C<yt>, can be used to run the entire YAML-Tests
suite against a particular Perl YAML implementation.

C<yt> is basically a wrapper around C<prove>. As such, it accepts and passes
along C<prove> command line options. The main difference is that it knows
where the YAML-Tests live and how to set up the environment to run them.

=head1 ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

C<yt> relies on two environment variables:

=over

=item PERL_YAML_TESTS_BASE

This variable should be set to the absolute pathname of the directory
containing the contents of the YAML-Tests module distribution.

You can get YAML-Tests from CPAN or its SVN repository:

    http://svn.kwiki.org/ingy/YAML-Tests/

=item PERL_YAML_TESTS_MODULE

This variable conatins the name of the Perl YAML module you want to
test. It can be set as an environment variable, but is normally passed
to C<yt> by the C<-M> flag:

    yt -MYAML::Syck
