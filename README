NAME
    YAML::Tests - Common Test Suite for Perl YAML Implementations

SYNOPSIS
        > yt YAML::Foo   # Run all YAML Tests against YAML::Foo implementation

DESCRIPTION
    YAML::Tests provides a common test suite against which to test Perl YAML
    modules. It also provides a Module::Install component to make it simple
    for YAML module authors to include the tests in their distributions.

    This module is primarily intended for YAML implementation authors
    (currently ADAM, AUDREY and INGY) and also for anyone who is interested
    in comparing the capabilities and quality of the various YAML modules.

    This module installs a command line tool called "yt" which can be used
    to run the tests against various implementations.
